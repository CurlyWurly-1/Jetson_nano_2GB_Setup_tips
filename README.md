# Jetson_nano_2GB_Setup_tips
Setup Tips 


1) INITIAL SETUP PROCEDURE  
   - Download the Jetson Nano 2GB image here
     - https://developer.nvidia.com/jetson-nano-2gb-sd-card-image
   - Use Balena Etcher to burn the image to a 64GB card
   - Insert card into Jetson Nano
   - connect the following
     - HDMI monitor
     - Mouse
     - Keyboard
     - Webcam
     - Network cable (don't use wifi dongle, it can slow the camera down)
   - Insert the power cable and it will boot up - follow the onscreen instructions until you get to desktop
   - In a terminal, execute the following 
     - sudo apt-get install nano
     - sudo apt-get update
     - sudo apt-get upgrade


2) HOW TO INSTALL A FAN ON HEATSINK
   - Install a fan (e.g. Noctua NF-A4x20 5V PWM )
   - Open a terminal and execute
     - git clone  https://github.com/Pyrestone/jetson-fan-ctl    
     - sudo ./install.sh 


3) HOW TO RESOLVE MEMORY PROBLEMS (Nano 2GB slows down/hangs if this is not done) 
   - Adjust the memory by Opening a terminal window and entering the following commands
     - free -m
     - sudo systemctl disable nvzramconfig
     - sudo fallocate -l 4G /mnt/4GB.swap
     - sudo chmod 600 /mnt/4GB.swap
     - sudo mkswap /mnt/4GB.swap
     - sudo nano /etc/fstab 
       - Add (or replace the existing swap line) the following line at the end, then "CtrlX" and then "CtrlO" to save
       - /mnt/4GB.swap swap swap defaults 0 0


4) REBOOT !!


5) ENROL IN COURSE HERE !!!
   - https://courses.nvidia.com/courses/course-v1:DLI+S-RX-02+V2/courseware/b2e02e999d9247eb8e33e893ca052206/63a4dee75f2e4624afbc33bce7811a9b/


5) INSTALL THE COURSE JUPYTER NOTEBOOK. 
   - In a terminal window, execute the following commands (it takes quite a bit of time to install). When it finishes, check what the IP address of the nano is <Nano_ip> and you can access the jupyter notebook with a web browser using a url of <NANO_IP):8888  (use "dlinano" as the password) 
     - mkdir -p ~/nvdli-data
     - echo "sudo docker run --runtime nvidia -it --rm --network host --volume ~/nvdli-data:/nvdli-nano/data --device /dev/video0  nvcr.io/nvidia/dli/dli-nano-ai:v2.0.2-r32.7.1" > docker_dli_run.sh
     - chmod +x docker_dli_run.sh
     - ./docker_dli_run.sh    
  
 
6) IF YOU REBOOT, GET THE JUPYTER NOTEBOOK BACK
   - If you reboot, the Jupyter notebook will not be running - You can bring it back by executing the last line of the above as follows (There is no need to re-install from scratch) by executing the following commands:
     - ./docker_dli_run.sh


7) INSTALL VSCODE
   - Download the .deb file for 'ARM64'. When downloaded, click on it, and in the next window, press "install". After it has installed, VsCode can be accessed in the "programming" section when you press the bottom left icon (like START in Windows!). Right click the VsCode icon and Select "add to desktop" for easy access
     - https://code.visualstudio.com/download


8) INSTALL PYTHON VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT. Execute the following in a terminal
   - In a terminal window, execute the following commands:
     - sudo apt-get install -y python3-venv
     - python3 -m venv .py3venv
     - ls -a
     - ls .py3venv/
     - source ~/.py3venv/bin/activate
     - deactivate


8) INSTALL PIP3
   - In a terminal window, execute the following commands:


9) INSTALL USEFUL LIBRARIES 
   - In a terminal window, execute the following commands:
     - sudo apt-get -y install python3-pip
     - pip3 install numpy
     - pip3 install gtts
     - pip3 install playsound
     - pip3 install pyttsx3
     - pip3 install pyserial

10) INSTALL "face_recognition". Follow the instructions here https://medium.com/@ageitgey/build-a-face-recognition-system-for-60-with-the-new-nvidia-jetson-nano-2gb-and-python-46edbddd7264
    - In a terminal window, execute the following commands:
      - sudo apt-get update
      - sudo apt-get install python3-pip cmake libopenblas-dev liblapack-dev libjpeg-dev
      - sudo pip3 -v install Cython face_recognition
      - wget http://dlib.net/files/dlib-19.17.tar.bz2 
      - tar jxvf dlib-19.17.tar.bz2
      - cd dlib-19.17
      - gedit dlib/cuda/cudnn_dlibapi.cpp
        - This will open up the file that we need to edit in a text editor. Search the file for the following line of code (which should be line 854) And comment it out by adding two slashes in front of it, so it looks like the following line. Save the file and close the editor. N.B. The next command will compile and install dlib and it will take around 30â€“60 minutes to finish (your Jetson Nano might get hot) - just let it run.
          - //forward_algo = forward_best_algo;
      - sudo python3 setup.py install
      - sudo pip3 install face_recognition
    
    
Now your Jetson Nano is ready to do face recognition with full CUDA GPU acceleration. On to the fun part!
