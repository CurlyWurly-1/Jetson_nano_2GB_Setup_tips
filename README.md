# Jetson_nano_2GB_Setup_tips
Setup Tips 


1) INITIAL SETUP PROCEDURE (Physical)  
   - Download the Jetson Nano 2GB image here
     - https://developer.nvidia.com/jetson-nano-2gb-sd-card-image
   - Use Balena Etcher to burn the image to a 64GB card
   - Insert card into Jetson Nano
   - connect the following
     - HDMI monitor
     - Mouse
     - Keyboard
     - Webcam
     - Network cable (don't use wifi dongle, it can slow the camera down)
   - Insert the power cable and it will boot up - follow the onscreen instructions until you get to desktop

2) HOW TO INSTALL A FAN ON HEATSINK
   - Shutdown / remove power
   - Install a fan (e.g. Noctua NF-A4x20 5V PWM ) and connect the 4 pin plug to the 4 pin connector
   - Insert power cable to boot up
   - Open a terminal and execute
     - git clone  https://github.com/Pyrestone/jetson-fan-ctl
     - cd jetson-fan-ctl
     - sudo ./install.sh 

3) INITIAL SETUP (Software) 
   - In a terminal, execute the following 
     - sudo apt-get update
     - sudo apt-get upgrade
     - sudo apt-get install nano

4) HOW TO RESOLVE MEMORY PROBLEMS (Nano 2GB slows down/hangs if this is not done) 
   - Adjust the memory by Opening a terminal window and entering the following commands
     - free -m
     - sudo systemctl disable nvzramconfig
     - sudo fallocate -l 4G /mnt/4GB.swap
     - sudo chmod 600 /mnt/4GB.swap
     - sudo mkswap /mnt/4GB.swap
     - sudo nano /etc/fstab 
       - Add (or replace the existing swap line) the following line at the end, then "CtrlX" and then "CtrlO" to save
       - /mnt/4GB.swap swap swap defaults 0 0


5) REBOOT !!

3) MORE SOFTWARE TO INSTALL 
     - pip3 install cython
     - pip3 install numpy
     - pip3 install gtts
     - pip3 install playsound
     - pip3 install pyttsx3
     - pip3 install pyserial
     - sudo apt-get update
     - sudo apt-get install python3-pip 
     - sudo apt-get install cmake 
     - sudo apt-get install libopenblas-dev 
     - sudo apt-get install liblapack-dev 
     - sudo apt-get install libjpeg-dev
     - sudo -H pip3 -v install Cython face_recognition


6) INSTALL THE COURSE JUPYTER NOTEBOOK. 
   - In a terminal window, execute the following commands (it takes quite a bit of time to install). When it finishes, check what the IP address of the nano is <Nano_ip> and you can access the jupyter notebook with a web browser using a url of <NANO_IP):8888  (use "dlinano" as the password) 
     - mkdir -p ~/nvdli-data
     - echo "sudo docker run --runtime nvidia -it --rm --network host --volume ~/nvdli-data:/nvdli-nano/data --device /dev/video0  nvcr.io/nvidia/dli/dli-nano-ai:v2.0.2-r32.7.1" > docker_dli_run.sh
     - chmod +x docker_dli_run.sh
     - ./docker_dli_run.sh    
   - If you reboot, you can bring back the Jupyter notebook by executing the last command of the above as follows (There is no need to re-install from scratch):
     - ./docker_dli_run.sh


7) ENROL IN COURSE HERE !!!

8) INSTALL VSCODE
   - Get the ".deb"file
     - Download the Ubuntu ".deb" file for "ARM64" from https://code.visualstudio.com/download
     - Right-click on the downloaded file and press "open Folder"
     - When the folder contents are displayed, double click the ".deb" file 
     - In the next window, press "install". 
     - After it has installed, the VsCode icon can be accessed when you press the bottom left icon (like START in Windows!) and look in the "programming" section.   
     - Right click the VsCode icon and Select "add to desktop" for easy access


9) INSTALL PYTHON VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT. Execute the following in a terminal
   - In a terminal window, execute the following commands:
     - sudo apt-get install -y python3-venv
     - python3 -m venv .py3venv
     - ls -a
     - ls .py3venv/
     - source ~/.py3venv/bin/activate
     - deactivate


10) INSTALL "face_recognition". Follow the instructions here https://medium.com/@ageitgey/build-a-face-recognition-system-for-60-with-the-new-nvidia-jetson-nano-2gb-and-python-46edbddd7264
    - In a terminal window, execute the following commands:
      - sudo apt-get update
      - sudo apt-get install python3-pip cmake libopenblas-dev liblapack-dev libjpeg-dev
      - sudo pip3 -v install Cython face_recognition
      - wget http://dlib.net/files/dlib-19.22.tar.bz2 
      - tar jxvf dlib-19.22.tar.bz2
      - cd dlib-19.22
      - gedit dlib/cuda/cudnn_dlibapi.cpp
        - This will open up the file that we need to edit in a text editor. Search the file for the following line of code (which should be line 854) And comment it out by adding two slashes in front of it, so it looks like the following line. Save the file and close the editor. N.B. The next command will compile and install dlib and it will take around 30â€“60 minutes to finish (your Jetson Nano might get hot) - just let it run.
          - //forward_algo = forward_best_algo;
      - sudo python3 setup.py install
      - sudo pip3 install face_recognition


    
Now your Jetson Nano is ready to do face recognition with full CUDA GPU acceleration. On to the fun part!
